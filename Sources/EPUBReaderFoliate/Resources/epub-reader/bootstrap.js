// The prototype's own glue between foliate-js and the StudyWright host.
//
// This is deliberately not foliate-js's `reader.html` / `reader.js` demo shell. Three reasons,
// all of them requirements rather than taste:
//
//  1. The demo shell calls `makeBook(file)`, which dispatches on the file's magic bytes and
//     dynamically imports the MOBI, PDF, CBZ and FictionBook handlers. Handing `view.open()` an
//     already-constructed `EPUB` instead means those imports are never evaluated, which is what
//     lets the bundle exclude them — and pdf.js's ~10 MB vendor tree with them — without
//     patching anything upstream.
//  2. The loader below refuses to hand the renderer any script resource, strips the markup that
//     would reach the network without fetching content, and counts both so the host can disclose
//     them.
//  3. The host's chrome (Contents, Quiz, Ask, the position indicator) is native. This page
//     renders the document and reports position and selection; it draws no UI of its own.
//
// Nothing here parses EPUB, ZIP or CFI. Those are foliate-js's, at the pinned commit recorded in
// asset-manifest.json.

// expression over the source sees what the XML parser will expand. That costs two parses per
// markup member. It costs no fidelity, because a member in which neither reading finds a hint
// is still returned as its original text.
//
// Both readings are searched because they can disagree about the same text: a CDATA section is
// character data to the XML parser and, to the HTML parser, a bogus comment that ends at the
// first `>`, so a link can exist in one reading and not the other. A hint in either counts.
//
// `parsererror` decides only which reading is serialised, and it is looked for only in the
// XHTML reading, which is the only one that can fail. It never decides *whether* to filter. A
// book can carry its own `<parsererror>`, literally or through an entity, and the HTML parser
// has no fatal errors, so on that reading the element can only be the book's; skipping any
// reading that contained one is how `<parsererror/>` beside `<link rel="preconnect">` used to
// come back unfiltered.
//
// The rewrite is then parsed again under both readings, and one that still carries a hint under
// either is not returned: the section is withheld instead. That is what makes choosing the wrong

// composed entirely of Unicode Format-category (`\p{Format}`) code points — "ignore formatting
// characters" (`!/[^\p{Format}]/u.test(segment)` → `continue`) — which is not a collapse to a
// space but a removal: that grapheme contributes *nothing* to the corpus string the query is
// compared against. U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE is Format-category, and Standard Ebooks'
// own typesetting places it directly between a word and a following em dash, invisibly, so the
// dash never opens a line on its own — measured directly against a real title, every one of its
// chapter files carried dozens. `ArchiveDocumentExtractor.extractEPUB` never touches it (it is
// neither `[ \t]` nor `\n`, the only characters whitespace normalization collapses), so it
// survives verbatim into a chunk's own text and into the quote this file is handed. Comparing
// that quote character for character against a corpus the matcher has already *removed* the
// same character from then disagrees at every one of those positions — an extra character in
// the quote, not merely a differently-spelled one — and because `view.search` requires its
// *whole* query to match one contiguous window, one disagreement anywhere in the quote fails the
// entire search. At that density, essentially no citation or quiz passage resolving into a chunk
// carrying the word joiner could ever be found (`ReaderEPUBLocateChapterRegressionTests`). Soft
// hyphen (U+00AD) is Format-category too, for the same reason typography inserts it invisibly.
// Stripping every Format-category grapheme here, then collapsing ordinary whitespace runs to a
// single space, mirrors exactly what the matcher already does to the side it walks live — not a
// new rule invented for this file. It does not by itself fix every reported symptom: a
// Contents row always resolves through a section's *first* chunk
// (`ReaderContentsPresentation.outline`'s de-duplication), and `ArchiveDocumentExtractor
// .extractEPUB`'s whole-document text walk (`XMLTextHarvester.strippingTags`) separately leaks

// by trusting an index. `view.search` is foliate-js's own book-wide matcher (`search.js`): it
// yields `{ index, subitems }` batches as each section is scanned, one `subitems` entry per
// match with the CFI already computed. The first match found — the first place the quoted text
// occurs in reading order — is where the citation goes.
//
// **`highlight` decides `select` vs. `goTo`, and both are followed by `clearSearch`.**
// `view.search` is not a silent lookup: `View.search` calls `addAnnotation` for every subitem it
// yields, on the way, which draws foliate-js's own `Overlayer.outline` (a red rectangle per
// visible line — `range.getClientRects()` returns one per line of a multi-line match) for every
// match it passed on the way to the one this file actually wants. Breaking out of the generator
// on the first hit — the `return` below — never runs `view.search`'s own generator body again, so
// nothing it already drew is ever removed by that call; only a fresh `view.clearSearch()` removes
// it, which is why one runs in `finally` on every exit from this function, found or not. Without
// it, a Contents jump or a citation landing leaves the book marked up with every outline `search`
// drew while scanning toward the match — the red boxes the owner reported after a Contents tap.
// `view.select` and `view.clearSearch()` are orthogonal (a native DOM `Selection`, not an overlay
// annotation), so clearing the search overlay immediately after selecting never touches the
// selection highlight itself.

// selects the whole matched range — a native, theme-aware highlight using the browser's own

// from bootstrap.js or Swift alone, whatever contentInset is tried.
//
// What *is* reachable: the paginator re-dispatches a plain, synchronous `scroll` `Event` on
// itself for every native scroll tick of `#container` (`this.#container.addEventListener(
// 'scroll', () => this.dispatchEvent(new Event('scroll')))`), and `start`, `size` and `viewSize`
// are public getters on the same element (`view.renderer`, already used by `setStyle` above).
// Neither of those requires reaching into the shadow root. So the fade below is a CSS gradient
// drawn in *this* page — two fixed divs outside the paginator's shadow tree, styled in
// `index.html` — kept in sync with scroll position through that public surface. It is a drawn
// approximation, not the system effect, and differs from it in one way worth naming: it resets to
// invisible at the top of every new section, because the closed shadow root gives this file only
// the current section's scroll position, never a whole-book one to fade a section boundary
// against — where a real UIScrollView-backed fade over one continuous document would not reset
// there at all.

// The owner's standing rule is to spend as little custom code as this reader can get away with
// and prefer a standard, platform-provided mechanism wherever one reaches the same result — the
// tap/click edge zones and the Mac keyboard bindings are consequently *not* in this file: they
// are a native SwiftUI tap gesture and `.onKeyPress` (`ReaderEPUBPrototypeSurface`,
// `ReaderEPUBWebView.swift`), which cost this page nothing at all. What is left here is only the
// input this page is the *sole* place able to observe: nothing in `paginator.js` binds wheel
// input at all, and its own touch handling (`#onTouchMove`) explicitly does nothing in
// continuous-scroll flow (`if (this.scrolled || state.pinched) return`) — scrolling there is
// native `#container` scrolling, entirely inside a closed shadow root
// (`doc/architecture.md`'s "Continuous-scroll edge fade" section), so no Swift-side gesture
// recognizer or scroll-view delegate can ever see it, and it stops dead at a section's own start
// or end with nothing to swap in more. `view.next()`/`view.prev()` — foliate-js's own public
// "turn a page, or, once already at this section's end/start, advance to the next/previous
// section" call (`Paginator.#turnPage`/`#scrollNext`/`#scrollPrev`) — is what both handlers below
// call once they notice the person pushing past that edge; this file supplies only the trigger.
//
// Attached per section document (`doc`, from the `load` event `attachSelection` and
// `attachEdgeFadeListenerIfNeeded` already key off): a section renders in its own iframe, and
// wheel/touch input over its content reaches that document directly, which is also why nothing
